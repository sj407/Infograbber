# Infograbber
A simple system's information grabber program under the guise of a tic tac toe game, when given an from and to email address, sends you the data of people who had played the game

Note: 
  1. It is better to convert this program to an exe file use pyinstaller.
  2. The from address and password to log in should be entered manually(currently, only gmail is supported).

Limitation:
  1. One has the manually enter the from and to address in the source code.
  2. One has to convert this into an .exe file to avoid suspicion.
  3. Needs an internet connection to send the data which the victim might not be having while running it.
  4. Relies on victim's lack of awareness.

To get app password(as google changed its security policy to allow only app passwords generated), check an online tutorial in youtube.
